                <p class="intro_par">Josefin Slab was the first typeface designed by Santiago Orozco. It follows the 1930s trend for geometric typefaces and is meant to be between Kabel and Memphis, but with modern details. The designer wanted to stick to the idea of Scandinavian style, so they put a lot of attention into the diacritics. It has some typewriter attribute inspired by Letter Gothic.</p>

                    <p class="body1">Nestled in a sun-dappled corner of an ancient estate, the light academia garden exudes an air of tranquility and intellectual charm. The pathways, lined with weathered stone, meander through a lush tapestry of greenery. Ivy climbs the weathered walls of a nearby study, where windows are framed by soft, white curtains that flutter gently in the breeze. The garden’s design encourages exploration and contemplation, with hidden nooks that invite moments of reflection or quiet reading.</p>
                    <p class="body2">A vibrant assortment of plants flourishes throughout the space. Delicate lavender sways gently, filling the air with a calming fragrance that mingles with the sweet notes of blooming jasmine. Towering sunflowers stand as cheerful sentinels, their bright faces turned toward the sun, while lush ferns create a soft carpet of green in shaded corners. Each plant seems to tell a story, from the resilient daisies that nod in the wind to the stately rosebushes bursting with layers of soft petals in various shades of pink and cream.</p>
                    <p class="body3">Amidst the flora, antique furniture adds a touch of character to the garden. A weathered wooden bench, adorned with soft cushions, provides the perfect spot for visitors to pause and indulge in a favorite book or sketch the enchanting surroundings. A small, wrought-iron table holds an assortment of well-thumbed volumes and a delicate teapot, inviting leisurely afternoons of tea and conversation. The garden feels like a sanctuary for the mind, where creativity can flourish among the blooms and whispers of nature.</p> 
                    <p class="body4">As dusk approaches, the garden transforms into a magical realm. Soft lanterns flicker to life, casting a warm glow on the path and illuminating the delicate petals of night-blooming flowers. The soft chirping of crickets and the gentle rustle of leaves create a symphony of sounds that enhance the garden’s serene atmosphere. Under a canopy of stars, this light academia garden becomes a haven for dreamers and thinkers alike, where nature and knowledge intertwine in perfect harmony.</p>
